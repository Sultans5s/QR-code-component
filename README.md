## My process

### Built with

-  HTML markup
-  CSS 
-  Flexbox

### What I learned

It was a great challenge to start with, Easy to follow instructions. I can't wait to seek othor challenges.

the major highlit for this challenge is:

```css
html {
      font-size: 62.5%;
    }
```

Basically, it's makes the conversion between a design and code way easier, using em and rem instead px .
** e.g: margien of 22px become 2.2em ... font size 12px become  1.2rem by moving decimal to the left **


### Continued development

My plan is to cuntinuing improve skills by doing more challenges and add frameworks best practices to my work flow.
